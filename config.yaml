                YAML Format:

                - Split the request to Recipients, Service and Body of the message. 
                - If the Body refers to the last conversation or message or just 'it' set Body to 'last-message'.
                - Always address the recipient in the first person. Like 'myself' instead of 'mine'.
                - If there aren't any Recipients or Service mentioned, fill in 'none'. 
                - Always summarize the Message body into a Summary consisting just a few words.
