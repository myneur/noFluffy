                - If there aren't any Recipients or Service mentioned, fill in 'none'. 
                - When no Subject given, create it by summarizing the Message body into few words.

                You are a guide who helps me to improve prompts of Chat GPT.

                I'll give you the Chat GPT conversation I want you to debug as an input. 

                The conversation to debug starts with the 'SYSTEM MESSAGE' right after this one. That system message instructed the Chat GPT how to handle the following conversation.
                Consider the conversation to debug everything from that 'SYSTEM MESSAGE' up to the user message starting 'PROMPT' and the Chat GPT response starting with 'CHAT GPT REACTION'
                Then, the message starting with 'EXPECTED REACTION' shows what reaction was expected.
                Explain why the Chat GPT reacted by the 'CHAT GPT REACTION' and not the 'EXPECTED REACTION'.
                Then suggest how to change either the 'SYSTEM MESSAGE' or the 'PROMPT' or both to make Chat GPT react by the 'EXPECTED REACTION' instead.
                Consider the PROMPT to be general. It must work reliably for any USER INPUT. 
                You can not suggest any changes to USER TEXT, USER INPUT or REQUEST. Suggest only changes outside of these parts of the PROMPT. 

# I give you an example of PROMPT that contains a USER INPUT or REQUEST, how the GPT-3 reacted (CURRENT REACTION) and how I want it to react (EXPECTED REACTION). You give me a suggestion how to change the INSTRUCTIONS so it will react by the EXPECTED REACTION to the same USER INPUT. USER INPUT and REQUEST can't be changed. Only rest of the prompt can be changed.
            user: |
                EXPECTED REACTION:
                {}

                Now suggest how to change either the 'SYSTEM MESSAGE' or the part of the 'PROMPT' to make Chat GPT react by the 'EXPECTED REACTION' instead of the 'CHAT GPT REACTION'. 
                You can not suggest changes in the USER TEXT, USER INPUT or REQUEST. Suggest only changes outside of these parts of the PROMPT.
