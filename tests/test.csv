You already told me that I can use Beware or Kivy to build an application for Android from just 
Python. Show me the code to build next application. It will only select one big button and that button

none,I want to demo my application in a video that will be sent over mail. The application is a purely 
conversational artificial intelligence assistant. The great thing about the assistant is that it
